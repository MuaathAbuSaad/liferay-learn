## Page Management

### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

The full documentation for these topics [can be found here](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-managing-pages)

When you are experimenting a bit with the different page types - figure out if there are other types than “Widget” that you want to make use of. Try “Panel”, “URL”, and “Link to page of this site” for example to figure out what they’re doing, what you can configure. Create a new page and change its type to one of the alternatives. See if you can find out what they’re doing. The vast majority of your time, you’ll probably use the “Widget” type, but it’s worth knowing that there are other alternatives. 

Note that we'll cover the "Content" pages in a different chapter - we'll need some additional introduction for those. This is a new page type in Liferay DXP 7.1
